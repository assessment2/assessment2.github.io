                <h4>What are the Job Titles for your group's ideal jobs?&nbsp;<br></h4>
                <p>Hamish Prasad: Cloud Engineer, Jack Abdo: Game Developer, Richard Saville: Software Engineer, Matt Robinson:<br></p>
                <h4>How do each of these rank in terms of demand from employers?<br></h4>
                <p>Software Engineer ranks the highest in terms of employer demand, with 8,619 vacant positions currently being advertised within Australia. Cloud Engineer ranks second, with an advertised 3,248 vacant positions. Games Developer loosely follows, with 1,139 available positions, thus making it arguably the most competitive of the chosen fields. <br></p>
                <h4>What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?<br></h4>
                <p>The three highest ranked general skills that are not in any of our required skill sets include writing, mentoring and presentation skills.&nbsp;<br></p>
                <h4>Given the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?<br></h4>
                <p>The Burning Glass data exhibits clearly that certain Job titles are more highly sought after than others amongst employers. Thus making particular fields (most notably game development and cloud engineering), more competitive to gain entry into. This has slightly changed our opinions on our ideal jobs, in the sense that certain general skills that we had not anticipated to be crucial, are in fact highly sought after. Particularly skills such as writing, creativity, mentoring, team building and presentation skills. Despite this data however, our ideal job titles remain the same, given that they are passion based. Thus the necessary IT-specific and general skills will need to be acquired through first hand experience and gaining the required qualifications.&nbsp;<br><br></p>

                <h4>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?<br></h4>
                <p>Of all the chosen fields, several IT specific skills rank highly in terms of demand from employers. The highest ranking of these is comprehensive knowledge of SQL, followed by JavaScript, both of which may be required for Software Engineering and Cloud Engineering. Project Management follows closely, a highly sought after skill among all our chosen titles. Fluency in .NET programming and Python, both of which are required for software engineering, come next. With Systems engineering, a large facet of Cloud Engineering, being the second last ranked skill amongst employers as stipulated by the Burning glass data.&nbsp;<br></p>
                <h4>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?<br></h4>
                <p>General skills required by our chosen fields rank in the order as follows; communication skills, problem solving, and organisational skills.&nbsp; <br></p>
                <h4>What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?<br></h4>
                <p>The three highest ranked general skills that are not in any of our required skill sets include writing, mentoring and presentation skills. <br></p>
