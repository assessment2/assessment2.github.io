                <p>Field requires subject to verify and validate applications within a controlled environment, to ensure that they meet all requirements, whilst being screened for bugs and errors before they are implemented or delivered to an end user, ensuring all facets of the product function as intended.&nbsp;<br></p>
                <p>Work Interactions:&nbsp;Subject is required to frequently liaise and coordinate tasks with the software developers. Communication is paramount to this role thus it is common for Test Analysts to coordinate with all involved departments, such as designers if there are issues with the GUI. Transparency between departments and the test analyst&nbsp; is key in order for the tested methods employed to be appropriate for the software and ensure that every potential point of failure is examined. Throughout the testing process, communication continues between all departments involved, until a final report of findings is submitted so that bugs can be addressed. Upon which, the software is retested.<br></p>
                <p>Time investment: Communication within this field is paramount, thus subject will often find themselves attending meetings with the heads of different departments to address issues that they or the department may be facing, as well as to discuss the test report findings. Whilst most communication is carried out via email and VoIP, physical meetings are also frequently held. Although Test Analysts often work within their own environment, physical meetings may also be attended if necessary.&nbsp; <br></p>
                <p>Challenging aspects:&nbsp;One of the most commonly faced dilemmas within this field is lacking test documentation. This occurs due to the dependence of most developers on verbal communication, however without documentation, key facets of the software may be left unexplored thus increasing the potential for bugs to exist, inhibiting the software’s functionality and the end user’s experience. Complications may also arise in the face of poor coordination between different departments. Given that the final product is generally the combined effort of multiple departments, a lack of transparency may prompt a situation where the software being examined is missing key components, thus the test analyst will be required to conduct additional testing that should not have been necessary.<br></p>

        <h1 class="text-left text-secondary">Autonomous Vehicles</h1>
        <p class="text-left">Hamish Prasad: Autonomous Vehicles, more commonly referred to as driverless cars, aim to offer users an automated means of transport that requires little physical interaction from the driver, in a manner which prioritises road safety and efficiency. This rapidly advancing innovation bears the potential to revolutionize transport within contemporary society, particularly through alleviating road congestion, even within it’s advent. Autonomous vehicles utilize a series of multiple sensors, most notably RADAR and LiDAR, which acquire positional data concerning the vehicle’s surroundings, including other automobiles, physical boundaries, lane markings and pedestrians (Ondruš, Kolla, Vertaľ and Šarić, 2020). This data is interpreted and analysed in real time by onboard predictive AI systems, and utilized in order to automate steering wheel position, braking and acceleration.&nbsp;<br></p>
        <p class="text-left">Currently, the automated driving capabilities of such vehicles are characterised by a tier system (Chan, 2017), with L1 featuring a barebones system that can monitor acceleration and maintain cruise speed controlling of speed increments can be handled without human intervention, however most functionality remains completely human controlled, L2 being partial automation of both steering and acceleration whilst still requiring human monitoring, L3 indicating conditional automation, the ability for the AI to monitor changes to the environment and perform all basic driving needs, L4 reflecting the car’s ability to adapt if there is a system failure or sudden obstacles, make decisions and drive safely without necessarily requiring human intervention. In any case, it very well might be altered not to work in unmapped zones or during extreme environments. L5 is characterised by the vehicle’s ability to monitor and drive without any human interaction, carrying out all tasks and eliminating the need for a steering wheel, acceleration, braking, and other manual controls (Zhao, Liang and Chen, 2018). Such technology is available more abundantly in the form of self parking cars, which detect the marked boundaries of an assigned parking space, and calculate the safest and most efficient means of parking the car within the designated space. Consumers have been granted a glimpse at the capabilities of this technology through current commercial offerings, however given safety concerns, mass adoption of driverless cars throughout society has yet to occur. That being said, the autonomous vehicle market is rapidly growing, currently worth over $54 billion, and estimated to reach $540 billion by 2026 (Jadhav, 2019).&nbsp;<br></p>
        <p class="text-left">Current state of the art implementations, most notably Tesla’s Model S (Autopilot - L2), Cadillac’s CT6 (Super Cruise - L2) and Audi’s A8 (L3), are made possible with predictive AI and imaging applications (Kurczewski, 2020). RADAR and LiDAR sensors collect images in real time of the vehicle’s surroundings and positional data, enabling the software to position the car within a virtual 3D space. Obstructions, lane markings and the movement data of surrounding vehicles or pedestrians, assist the AI in making decisions that determine the car’s movement. The current goal of today’s state of the art autonomous vehicle manufacturers is to reduce the latency between the acquisition of images by the sensors, and completion of the AI’s interpretation, to zero. As of now, L2 autonomous cars have successfully exhibited the ability to maintain cruising speeds, park, and halt in the case of obstruction (Chan, 2017).<br></p>
        <p class="text-left">It is expected that in time, more mainstream car manufacturers will find a means to overcome the current imaging concerned technological boundaries that prevent L3 tier vehicles from being produced on a mass scale (Zhao, Liang and Chen, 2018). Current imaging technologies, particularly RADAR, video, and LiDAR sensors, are plagued by issues with focus, visibility through fog, and inhibited depth perception. However, research into thermal imaging sensors has provided a means for such limitations to be addressed, given that they detect frequencies of light on a much broader scale than the visual spectrum, proving to be effective in environmental conditions where video feed falls short, as exhibited by FLIR System’s recent imaging sensors (Cannon, 2019). Thus autonomous vehicle technology may advance towards the mass implementation of thermal imaging, with RADAR, LiDAR and video feed as secondary sensors.&nbsp;<br></p>
        <p class="text-left">Almost 1.3 million individuals die in vehicle crashes across the world each year, which makes it around 4,000 passings each day (Road traffic injuries, Fagnant, 2017). Many fatalities occur exclusively because of carelessness, rash driving, being affected by intoxicating substances, or other avoidable human blunders. Subsequently, vehicle protection is a multi-billion dollar business. Yet, when there is not a human driver behind the guiding, and the vehicle would explore environments with the assistance of LiDAR and AI calculations, the likelihood of vehicle accidents would be insignificant. Furthermore, this would bring about fewer individuals choosing protections and, in the end, lead to insurance agencies bearing substantial misfortunes.<br></p>
        <p class="text-left">MIT analysts anticipate that autonomous vehicles would impact where individuals decide to live (Bissell, Birtchnell, Elliott and Hsu, 2018). Driving can be a horrendous ordeal for some, particularly when they need to invest a lot of energy out and about in the pains of traffic. In any case, individuals can live a long way from their work environments with fully autonomous vehicles. Commutes will be more bearable since the time generally spent driving can be diverted into other productive activities. Another huge manner by which autonomous vehicles can affect contemporary society is the decision of self-reliant living. For the older, debilitated, self-driving vehicles will tremendously influence their lives since travelling via car will no longer be limited by the individual’s physical capacity to operate a car manually, empowering outwardly disabled individuals (Bissell, Birtchnell, Elliott and Hsu, 2018).<br></p>
        <p class="text-left">Andreas Tschiesner depicts the likely reality of autonomous vehicles having a substantial impact on the economy. He goes further in his exploration to say that there will be a decrease in transport and train drivers and government employees who work in broad daylight public transport roles and traffic divisions. While this may look like negative news, Tschiesner provides some solace by expressing that the implementation of autonomous vehicles in urban communities will prompt an ascent in the demand for researchers and engineers to help govern and maintain both the vehicles themselves, and the way in which society functions around them (Tschiesner, 2018). Discourse regarding the safety of the mass implementation of self driving vehicles can also be anticipated, given that the technology is arguably still in its infancy, with L4-L5 tier autonomous cars only just being developed. Many individuals may feel unsafe to have to share roads with vehicles that are being driven autonomously, and thus may show disapproval of their commercial introduction to the market (Schwalb, 2021).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>
        <p class="text-left">The impact of L3-L5 tier autonomous vehicles on contemporary society, will extend further into the personal lives of not only myself but those around me, given that I have a family member who is unable to operate a car due to a physical disability. A fully autonomous mode of transportation would grant individuals facing that scenario with unprecedented independence, no longer needing to rely on others to travel. This independence may also offer vast benefits towards mental health. Within my personal life, implementation of such developments would enable me to no longer rely on public transport for daily commutes, thus lowering the risk of potentially contracting an illness, given that I am immunocompromised and do not currently hold a full license, ruling out the opportunity for me to drive a car myself. <br></p>

    <h1>&nbsp; &nbsp; Blockchain and Crypto currency</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <p>Jack Abdo: Block-Chain and Crypto-currency. Block-Chain technology can best be described as a ledger for storing data. Block-chain and crypto-currency are described and mentioned in the same sentence together for a reason, Crypto-currency such as Bit-coin would not even exist if it were not for the platform that a block-chain provides. In other words Block-chain technology enables a record of transactions that can exist without detection in a secure protected ledger that is unique in each and every transaction. With a distributed and networked data-base structure which is secured by hashing power, this allows for transactions to be completed without an intermediary, however these transactions can be complicated as they are also permanent and unalterable but then at the same time also anonymous and transparent with other transactions on the block chain. In conclusion these transactions have a state of the art ability to operate without the possibility of interference, providing the ultimate anonymity and security for users.<br><br></p>
        <p><br>Looking to the immediate-3 year future of Block-chain and crypto-currency technology is a broad theme: as Block-chain and crypto-currency technology itself is a by-product of predicting the future, due to the sudden rise in value from crypto-currency such as Bit-Coin and the early investors driving Lamborghini which lended it fame in its early mainstream days. There is no doubt that block-chain and crypto-currency sections are rising in advancement, development and growth, with marked evidence as recent as late 2020 provides. Aside from the fact that almost anything tangible can hold value in a Block-chain, examples such as a business all the way to items such as a vehicle. However there are other areas that deserve more attention, the reason being they are more ripe for growth than others; areas such as Govt. Tax enforcement and Central bank digital currencies which more or less are big corporations trying to eat their way into a slice of the marketplace pie. It is projected that major banks will start releasing their own versions of online currency making an interesting viewing on how that will impact upon the privacy and security of finances (as there always are with new advancements in technology). It is also projected that tax enforcement will escalate, and that collection agencies around the globe will take a fresh look on potential revenue block-chain can provide.<br><br></p>
        <p><br>As far as other developments are concerned, a major factor that helps propel Block-chain and make it the technology of the future, not just for mainstream businesses but for anyone with the proper education on usage is its ability to send and exchange currency internationally and across the globe meaning anyone with a computer can be traded with at any given time, while typical transferring costs might incur a 20% fee for example, Block-chain has the capability to make this process free. Education wise, Block-chain may transform the way educational records are stored at schools and universities; MIT in 2017 has already started giving students certificates of graduation digitally through a block-chain in order to prevent the misuse of fake credentials being used against potential employers looking for qualified candidates. Higher education institutions have also begun accepting crypto-currency as a form of payment, eliminating massive credit card fees that students may have incurred in the past. Overall Block-chain is still an emerging technology, so predictions are mixed about it’s potential. However, what can be said through looking at how the market is structured currently, is that by 2022 at least one innovative business built on block chain technology will be worth 10 billion dollars. By 2026 the business value added by block-chain will grow to over 360 billion dollars, and then by 2030 that value rises to over 3.1 trillion dollars.<br><br></p>
        <p><br>The likely impact that Block-chain and crypto-currency will have not just on a singular business industry but all business industries is quite significant, because each block chain is unique therefore&nbsp; a Block-chain exists for storing educational credentials and another stores multiple forms of currency, one may be encrypted and private where as another will be public and accessible. The area which Block-chain is projected to grow in the most is Cyber-Security; as previously mentioned this is because of Block-chain’s ability to be able to encrypt data so that it cannot be tampered with further; hence the use in educational institutions when mentioning validity and potential employers. The immediate impact of Block-Chain resides in the banks; for which Block-chain technology will allow to significantly reduce the excessive bureaucracy that is often associated with them which makes their customers used to dealing with slow transactions and fees, Block-chain eliminates this. Once banks have incorporated a Block-chain process such as Reise-Bank AG in Germany did when they completed a cross border transaction in less than 20 seconds in 2016. 77% of financial institutions are expected to adopt block chain technology by 2020, making for a huge splash in the value of most Crypto-currencies, one prediction is that once the banks have fully adapted block-chain into their systems they will derive 1 billion dollars of business value from all block chain based crypto-currencies making them second rate in terms of the market share. Therefore this makes block chain based crypto-currencies investors the people that will be the most affected by this impact, unless they are educated enough to predict the above mentioned and subsequently invest in shares of major banks. The crypto-currency value they believed to be high and decided to invest in will now drop significantly, forcing them to lose major amounts of revenue and assets.<br><br></p>
        <p><br>How will crypto-currency and block chain based technology affect my future? Like most other people working in different sectors amongst society, I will also be impacted majorly by the changes invoked and the ripple effect block chain is projected to have on the way data is stored and managed. It will affect my daily life and how I choose to invest in businesses first and foremost as the projections enable the scale of operation and the future of business to change dramatically, therefore the way I make decisions on financial investment now is destined to change, as it even has in this case today from researching block chain based technology and reading from multiple sources about how it is scheduled to affect change. For my immediate family and relatives, I’m sure not much will change as they are not so well versed in the knowledge of Information technology and I’m more adept at understanding and handling concepts such as block chain technology than them. Although I will do my best to explain, I foresee a lot of confusion and a high demand for block-chain experts, not only amongst my family; who ask me to fix the Wi-fi when all that needs to be done is a modem reset. But also in large scale business operations where specific knowledge of block chain technology can help push companies ahead of one another. I feel as though everything will be different for me regardless of block chain based technology and the high rate in which it is projected to take over data encryption and cybersecurity. In the near future anything is possible, as we saw through last year and the pandemic that brought with it major change and diversity shift. One thing that remained constant with a disease spreading world-wide was block chain technology and crypto currency, and once I’m settled into the workforce I’m sure that I will be living in a completely different world where block chain intersects with my personal and professional life.&nbsp;&nbsp;References<a href="https://www.gettingsmart.com/2020/02/how-blockchain-could-impact-education-in-2020-and-beyond/"><em>https://www.gettingsmart.com/2020/02/how-blockchain-could-impact-education-in-2020-and-beyond/</em></a><a href="https://aithority.com/guest-authors/blockchain-technology-in-the-future-7-predictions-for-2020/"><em>https://aithority.com/guest-authors/blockchain-technology-in-the-future-7-predictions-for-2020/</em></a><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/forget-bitcoin-blockchain-future/"><em>https://www.investopedia.com/tech/forget-bitcoin-blockchain-future/</em></a><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/4-ways-blockchain-will-transform-higher-education/"><em>https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/4-ways-blockchain-will-transform-higher-education/</em></a><a href="https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/handle/2123/20277/Gainsbury%20-%20How%20blockchain%20and%20cryptocurrency%20technology%20could%20revolutionize%20online%20gambling%20pre-print%20v1.pdf?sequence=2"><em>https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/handle/2123/20277/Gainsbury - How blockchain and cryptocurrency technology could revolutionize online gambling pre-print v1.pdf?sequence=2</em></a><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp"><em>https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp</em></a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/2020/04/the-future-of-blockchain/"><em>https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/2020/04/the-future-of-blockchain/</em></a><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/seansteinsmith/2020/12/22/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-and-blockchain-predictions-for-2021/"><em>https://www.forbes.com/sites/seansteinsmith/2020/12/22/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-and-blockchain-predictions-for-2021/</em></a><a href="https://www.gettingsmart.com/2020/02/how-blockchain-could-impact-education-in-2020-and-beyond/"><em>https://www.gettingsmart.com/2020/02/how-blockchain-could-impact-education-in-2020-and-beyond/</em></a><br><br></p>

        <h1>Robotics</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <p><br>The field of robotics has long undergone rapid advancements, most notably since the advent the 21st century. The field can be considered the amalgamation of developments in both engineering and science to create programmable or autonomous machinery with the intent to imitate physical human actions and traits, and perform actions humans can not Hu, H., 2012. Robotics. Early innovations in robotics aided in monotonous tasks, particularly robotic arms designed for use in automobile assembly lines. However, recent advances have granted robots to carry out increasingly complex tasks including bomb defusal, handling fires, as well as enabling surgeons to carry out intricate maneuvers with unprecedented accuracy. Robots have been designed with varying capacities for autonomous function, from pre programmable robots that require human commands, to fully autonomous creations that can make their own judgement based on machine learning without human interaction Hu, H., 2012. Robotics.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
        <p><br>One current state of the art application of robotics that is currently used is robot-assisted surgery Satava, R., 2004. This has granted doctors to perform many difficult surgical maneuvers with unprecedented precision and accuracy, to degrees higher than what was previously capable. Typically, robot-assisted surgery involves the use of a camera, viewed by the surgeon, and multiple arms equipped with various surgical tools. This application of robotics requires the surgeon to directly control the arms, however, it is considered state of the art as it grants the doctor with a magnified view of the subject, enabling precision at a level that ensures the patient’s well being during recovery to a significantly higher degree Satava, R., 2004.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
        <p><br>Presently, robotics can be classified by five main categories, Humanoid, Programmed, Autonomous, Teleoperated and Augmenting. A notable application of this technology can be seen in automotive assembly lines. The robot can perform far more efficiently than a human, with increased precision, these are generally applied in scenarios involving welding, insertion of sensitive components into difficult areas such as the engine. These mechanical arms can perform tasks significantly faster than humans. Robots that mimic human behavior and appearance have also been developed and are typically labelled Humanoid robots. They boast the ability to carry objects, walk and sprint, and often times feature human like faces that can show expression. The most notable innovator in this sector is Boston dynamics, with their “Atlas”, a robot designed to carry out tasks in environments deemed too harsh for humans, without supervision. They utilize a multitude of sensors, including thermal, lidar and radar, to monitor 3D surroundings in real time, which is then processed with machine learning, enabling the robot to make decisions that determine how the robot should interact with the surrounding environment. A notable application of autonomous robotic technology can be seen with the Roomba. A robotic, self operating vacuum cleaner that senses it’s surroundings, enabling it to make movement decisions within a home. Semi-autonomous robots are typically still human controlled, but can be operated from greater distances, enabling humans to not be physically present within their vicinity. These robots are generally employed to work within dangerous conditions. Semi-autonomous robots have been deployed to work at vast depths within the ocean to service pipes, or to investigate suspicious packages that could contain explosives. The last category of robots, dubbed augmenting robots, are designed to enhance existing human functions or re-grant them to individuals who may have lost certain physical abilities. These robotic developments can grant humans greater speed, agility and strength. An example of this application today are prosthetic limbs given to amputees, or hydraulic-assisted arms that grant users strength. <br><br></p>
        <p><br>Within the next 3 years, an increased adoption of AI machine learning into robotics is anticipated, further granting robots the ability make their own guided and non guided decision concerning the tasks assigned, whilst taking into account their surrounding environment with sensor technology Raj, M., Seamans, R. Primer on artificial intelligence and robotics. J Org Design 8, 11 (2019).&nbsp;<br><br></p>
        <p><br>One key technological development prompting the advancement of robotics is the adoption and incorporation of AI and machine learning. Currently robotic machines that utilize machine learning boast the ability to scan their environment to recognize particular objects irrespective of their location. Machine learning has also granted robots the ability to learn how to deal with unfamiliar circumstances, particularly handling foreign objects. AI has also proven to be beneficial to movement technology, allowing robots to make decisions concerning movement in unfamiliar or dynamic terrains, thus granting them the ability to perform tasks that may be dangerous to humans.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
        <p><br>Along with its praise, several negative impacts have also been anticipated from the future advancement and mass implementation of robotic devices. This primarily manifests within the concern for job loss due to AI. As of now, many jobs centered around manual labour have already been carried out by robots, replacing jobs that were once carried out by humans. It is feared that in the future, only jobs that require creativity or analytical decision making will remain. Research conducted by B. McKinsey suggests that by 2030 one third of all jobs involving manual labour may be replaced by automated machinery, thus it is expected to significantly disrupt the job market.&nbsp; However it is also anticipated that many jobs will be created, for such machinery must also be designed and maintained, as well as providing a new platform for innovation.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
        <p><br>In the future this could affect me regarding automation in the kitchen, automated cooking and currently automated cleaning, Roombas are very common in households and work well, they can get advanced depending on the money you spend. Not only those things, but companies have started using drones to deliver packages, whether it is food or online goods it will affect me as I will get my orders a lot quicker. If I were to get into an accident where I lost a limb, robotics has gotten advanced enough that I could get a replacement and it is not too much of a handicap.I think a lot would be different with the advancement of robotics, depending on how far we are talking it could go from something simple such as delivering delivered items to medical robots doing surgery which could end up being a lot cheaper than actual doctors, cooking robots as I said above, this is already a thing that is happening; not like in the movies but a lot simpler. Being able to not have to worry about cooking not only give you a lot more spare time but could also end up saving you a lot of money in the long run and being healthier.This could have a lot of benefits for friends but could also have a lot of downsides. Working in manufacturing of any sort is a dangerous game as you would be some of the easiest workers to become redundant, same even with retail. Some Countries are even experimenting with law enforcement in robot form; not like robo-cop but still it is something that could advance in the future and make a lot of people redundant. But the positives for a lot of people, we could find ourselves having a much lower cost of living due to so many of the labor jobs being taken by robotics. Basically at the end of it all, I think we will all come out on top.<br><br></p>

        <h1>Natural Language Processing <br></h1>
        <p><br>Richard Saville: Natural Language Processing is the part of Artificial Intelligence that handles interaction between programs, computers and people, simply put it is a method of handling data that allows computers to process large amounts of text. Unlike the more common “pattern matching” technique that chatbots use, NLP will take in a large amount of text and sort it into key words looking for patterns then sorting it into an index that shows importance; this is an incredibly powerful piece of technology when it comes to many fields, the ability to pull key words and learn large amounts about a person without ever needing to speak with them and Using it to help with peoples issues or queries.<br><br></p>
        <p><br>The concept for NLP has been around for a very long time, one of the earliest concepts of NLP was used in a chatbot called ELIZA; it would build off what the users would say and become smarter. But in more modern times NLP and chatbots have become something that people use every day, for example Alexa; when you speak to your virtual assistant it will process the words being said, send it to NLP and once it has processed it return the results. Not only in that concept does it assist people but also makes people be able to do things on the fly without having to stop.<br><br></p>
        <p>A very large number of things use NLP chatbots now, whether it is the simpler idea of a (chatbot) but for example you could view Google as a chatbot, google uses NLP to process your request and can return results also corrections on what it thinks you said. But the more prominent example of NLP chatbots is Virtual Assistants, allowing you to say a request and for it to process what you said and return an answer, whether it is a simple “OK” to asking for it to do something for you and it follows up with a question. Companies also use NLP chatbots to handle queries and complaints about their company, usually in tandem with a human; the program will find out what the query is, try and solve it and if it cannot pass it along to a human.<br><br></p>
        <p><br>In the near future you will find NLP chatbots popping up for many companies or websites wanting to have a cheaper solution than outsourcing to customer service, in the next 3 years I feel it will get very difficult to tell the difference between human responses and AI Generated responses. Not only in customer service but also in everyday life with virtual assistants being able to learn things about their user and predict things about them. This technology could be used in things like video games as well, for example being able to have the characters in the game change what they might say depending on key things the player has said or done.&nbsp;I think there has always been a demand in ways for people to document dates, reminders or events that are happening easily, we have seen it with blueberry phones in the past (and clearly calendars) but having the ability to speak to a computer and it manage a large amount of your life is very easy and knowing that you will be reminded is something people enjoy. If the development in Personal Assistants and Customer Service bots is funded and progressing, then NLP chatbots will continue to progress with them. As the process for refining the words and finding the key words improves then the speed in which these bots can reply and understand what is happening will also improve. I think there are a very large number of aspects to this field, and it will progress very quickly in the coming years.<br><br></p>
        <p><br>I think this technology has a massive impact on people every day and continues to evolve, having an even bigger impact as more things become automated with chatbots, phone assistants and loss of jobs by becoming redundant. Even just from an NLP point of view so many things use this, Search Engines, Text Prediction, Translation, Assistants. If this technology did not exist, I think a large amount of the internet would collapse.<br><br></p>
        <p><br>As this technology develops, I think people will rely on it more and more as people will realize how useful and powerful it can be to talk to a computer and be able to listen to what you say while responding and even do commands such as shopping, booking flights and appointments.I think this technology will change how people do things in their everyday life, even with booking appointments, whether it is a virtual assistant or a phone assistant it still uses the same technologies. This technology has already changed a lot with Virtual Assistants but even with online chatbots that you can hold conversations with, there are some people who cannot hold conversations very well and for those people, as this technology processes it will affect them greatly.I think this technology will affect a large amount of the workforce, online customer support for example where people would usually speak to a person about issues or support on where to find things, these can easily be replaced by an AI that is smart enough to understand the question. Retail could be affected as well as people could use their assistants to find specific clothing items they want just by describing them. These changes are already being seen in many places within Australia, for example Centrelink has already moved from talking to people on the phone immediately to having to speak to a virtual assistant, and as that assistant gets smarter it will make more people redundant.<br><br></p>
        <p><br>As a programmer I think this has a large affect on what we can deliver to clients, especially as the technology becomes more advanced and automated. Eventually it will get to a point where we would be able to write a program that takes input and passes it to an API and just receives a response with the answer. I can see great things coming within this field in terms of accessibility to the tech which would as I stated above, allow myself and others to use it to write programs for companies.Honestly, I do not use Assistants too much, but as I stated above. But in the future, I will probably move to using Assistants as it is simply a great benefit to be able to tell a computer something that you need done or talk to it to figure out something. And regarding assistance chat bots, it will change if I ever need to file a complaint online.I do not think much will change for me personally as I tend to prefer talking to people, but I guess I will find out eventually as this technology will progress; I might not even realize I am speaking to a computer. From a professional point of view, I think a lot will change as it is a very cool and interesting piece of tech.I think regarding Customer Support and Assistants, my family will be affected greatly, whether it be in their jobs or simply by the accessibility they receive from the technology. My sisters complain a lot to restaurants online is what I am trying to say.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
