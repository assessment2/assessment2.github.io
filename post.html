                    <h1>Overview</h1>
                    <p><br>The Real-time, Interactive Wall Mountable Audio Visualizer (RIAV) offers users a non-static, unobtrusive, interactive, and clear window-like interior decoration that showcases the technological marvel that is the Raspberry Pi; in doing so, the real time rendering capabilities of ARM (Advanced RISC Machines)<strong> </strong>architecture. With an ever increasing range of home and industrial lighting accessories and decor items being purchased by today’s consumers, notably younger homeowners, we have a strong reason to believe this device will perform well in the home lighting industry. We anticipate that this will boost further interest in artistic Linux based applications among users. On the screen will be displayed a perpetually running frequency and amplitude based oscilloscope which will render synaesthesia-like abstract visualisations in accordance to the frequencies recorded within the surrounding environment by utilizing Fast Fourier Transforms (math function), whether it's individuals having a conversation, or loud music, thus visually accompanying the mood of the encircling space surrounding the environment, all in real-time. Thus playing a particular song will render a certain sequence of visualisations, and ambient sound will render an ever evolving oscillating mandala of dynamic colour formations that's distinctive to the atmosphere of the area and noise presence.<br><br></p>
                    <h1>Motivation</h1>
                    <p><br>The primary motivation for the development of this product stems from a randomized controlled study examining the effects of mandalas on anxious thoughts, moods, and mindfulness, conducted by C. Estelle Campenni (2019). The study featured 69 undergraduates in an anxiety inducing environment, being placed in four separate rooms, one empty, another with other individuals, and two of the rooms repeated but with digital, evolving mandalas present in dimly lit conditions. Each participant was asked to complete a reflection piece, which would later be analysed in the sense of how each individual answered the questions, and their expression. The study found that subjects in the two dimly lit rooms occupied by digital mandalas displayed a substantial improvement in mood, mindfulness, and a noteworthy reduction in anxiety, fortified by both how the participants answered and exemplified further through their linguistic choices. Thus, this study greatly motivated our team to pursue our goal with the RIAV, for not only aesthetic purposes, but therapeutic benefits to the users.<br><br></p>
                    <p><br>Studies conducted by Schrade, Tronsky and Kaiser, 2011, revealed that mandala’s have long been deemed one of the most effective coping mechanisms for psychological distress, thus a digital means of rendering such a display in a manner which reacts to ongoing atmosphere and sound would be greatly sought after.<br>Motivation for the development of this product further stems from the rapidly increasing incorporation of LED decor lighting and abstract art pieces in everyday homes. Statista cites that the art sector has been subject to significant growth in recent years, being valued at an estimated 67 billion dollars in 2018 (Statista. 2020) . This has been accompanied by rapid growth in the cumulative global volume of art piece sales, increasing by a total of 1 million transactions in 2018 to 39 million transactions (Topic: Art market, 2020). A further recent spike in sales has also been attributed to the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic (Duron, 2020), with many individuals finding themselves wanting to further the visual appeal of their homes with aesthetic content and smart devices which aid day to day tasks, notably Amazon Echo. Despite the apparent growth however, a gap in the market perpetuates, for a low cost, dynamic, reactive art piece that is unobtrusive and showcases the rapid progression of technology in a manner which prompts interest.<br><br></p>
                    <h1>Description</h1>
                    <p><strong>Fast Fourier Transform</strong><br>The software written to render the visualiser will utilize a math function known as the Fast Fourier Transform. FFT is a pivotal means of quantifying sonic and acoustic data and is prevalent throughout many devices utilized today (<em>Raharjo, B. and Zakaria, M., 2019)</em>. It functions by transforming an oncoming signal into individual spectral additives, providing real time frequency analysis relative to time, which can be graphed. FFTs are used for the analysis of faults and inconsistencies within building material, as well to produce frequency spectrographs which are heavily utilized by audio professionals. This function is derived from the Discrete Fourier Transformation. It involves obtaining a small sample of an audio stream, generally a very short period of time, and A frequency is sampled over a period of time (a single wave cycle) and divided into individual components with respect to time. Each recorded oscillation has its own amplitude, with phase also being denoted.&nbsp;<br><br></p><img src="assets/img/asdgasdg.png">
                    <p><br>The interactive art piece comprises of a transparent OLED screen with a resolution of 1080 x 1920 (avoiding 4k to put less stress on the Pi)&nbsp; that will display the output of a real time visual frequency analysis tool written in the JS (Jesusonic) language, which is optimized for audio applications (Watson, 2013). Input signal from the inbuilt mic will be analyzed within software running on a Raspberry Pi optimized Linux Distribution (piCore, a Tiny Core Linux port). Each incoming band of frequencies will be assigned a different shape and colour, thus rendering colourful 2D particle fractal formations in a mandala arrangement that vary in colour and size in accordance to the incoming frequency content, ie teal/blue for mid range frequencies attributed to the human voice, red for lower bass frequencies found in music, and orange/yellow for higher frequencies that can be attributed to ambient noise. Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) will be utilized to The brightness of such formations will be directly assigned to the amplitude of the incoming signal, thus the louder individuals talk/have music playing, the brighter and larger the cloud formations displayed will be, and vice versa, ensuring a dynamic, non static experience that exhibits the full potential of ARM based infrastructure. This ultimately grants viewers with an abstract display of colours that is ever changing, in accordance to surrounding sound. Thus listening to a certain song will render a certain oscillated fractal pattern with colours that can not be reproduced any other time, or if the atmosphere of the room changes. When a particular frequency is detected by the spectrograph analysis tool, a diffused line will be rendered on screen, with lower frequencies (ie doors being closed, knocking, bass in music) assigned to a central position on the screen and higher frequencies (individuals talking, TV playing in background) assigned to outer areas. The displayed result will be a continuous, every changing 2D mandala rendered by the onboard ARM CPU. The mandala will oscillate continuously at a velocity determined by the amplitude of the incoming sound, i.e. how loud/quiet the room is. This will be directly assigned using JS commands using the data interpreted by a noise gate. Thus -30 db&nbsp; to -10db correlates to the mandala moving at 1-10 RPM, whilst -10 to 0 db would increase the rate of oscillation to 10-15 RPM, thus granting users a dynamic experience that reacts in real time to any activity in the room which may produce noise.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
                    <h1>Tools and Technologies</h1>
                    <p><br><strong>Hardware</strong><br>The digital mandala comprises a transparent, window-like, flexible, slim, 42 inch diagonal length monitor that can be wall mounted, with the Raspberry Pi situated within the bottom bezel. The Raspberry Pi, will be connected to an external power supply that can be hidden away from the display via a thin cable. Many companies, most notably Samsung, have showcased flexible OLED technology in recent years, allowing users to display vivid, high colour gamut content on a screen with greater strength than a traditional glass IPS panel (Samsung US Newsroom, 2018). LG have also boasted such technology in a transparent format for digital signage use cases (McCann, 2020) . Another key feature of the device, given that it is running a fully featured Linux OS, is the ability for users to display whatever content they desire on the OLED display, including photos and videos. This enables it to function as more than a mere art piece, opening doors to signage applications or serving as a digital photo frame.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>In order to accomplish such a feat utilizing Fast Fourier Transforms, the software will analyse small fragments of oncoming audio, which will be stored within the RAM. The rate at which these fragments are recorded can be defined as the sample rate (Fs), measured in Kilohertz. For the purposes of the RIAV, a sample rate of 44.1kHZ will be utilized. 44.1 being the approximate amount of samples being recorded per every second. Another important parameter is the quantity of samples being recorded, commonly referred to as the blocklength. The blocklength the written software will utilize must be the power of an integer of 2. For our purposes we will be utilisting 1024 samples (2^10). With data concerning both samplerate (Fs) and blocklength, we can quantify further parameters, namely the Bandwidth (Fn) or Nyquist frequency, which directly reveals the highest oncoming frequency that is compatible with the FFT.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
                    <p><br>Fn = Fs/2&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></p>
                    <p><br>Thus at the sample rate we have chosen (44.1kHz), the FTT will be able to determine additives up to approximately 22.05kHz. Thus 22.05kHz is essentially the highest frequency the FFT will be able to display. This sample rate was chosen as even the highest frequencies of humanly audible sounds are generally below 22kHz, ensuring that the device will be reactive to all incoming sound within the environment it is situated within. The duration of each cycle (D) can also be derived with both the sample rate and blocklength. With D = BL/Fs. Thus for our scenario, with Bl being 1024 and Fs being 44.1kHz, the duration of each segment will be 1024/44100 = 23.22 milliseconds. Another necessary parameter that can be calculated with the acquired data is the frequency of spacing between every two recorded measurements (df). This is derived by <em>df = fs / BL, </em>thus in our scenario, df = 44100/1024 = 43.07 Hz.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
                    <p><br>These parameters are crucial to the development of our software given that with small blocklength, we will achieve faster recording of measurements of frequency resolution (the amount of frequency changes recorded per second) to larger <em>(Singleton, R., 1969. A short bibliography on the fast Fourier transform. IEEE Transactions on Audio and Electroacoustics, 17(2), pp.166-169)</em>. However with a large blocklength, recording of measurements of frequency resolution will be slower, allowing a finer visualisation, however being significantly more taxing on the Raspberry Pi’s CPU.&nbsp;The Raspberry Pi will be optimized to run a fully featured instance of piCore 9.0, a lightweight Linux distribution that is most suitable for the onboard hardware of the device (Singh, 2017). This distribution has proven to be less straining on the ARM CPU, whilst utilizing the least amount of memory, ensuring that the device is energy efficient. Being that it is a RAM based OS, dedicated SSD storage can be dedicated solely to other more crucial software. Within the Linux command line, piCore will be configured to boot automatically into Reaper, a lightweight Linux based digital audio workstation (Lendino, 2019), upon turning on the device. Within Reaper, a direct in line audio feed (taken from a concealable USB mic attached to the Pi) is routed into a noise gate to interpolate the amplitude of the incoming signal, followed by a tailor made JS (Jesusonic) plugin, a easily accessible and editable programming language specifically tailored for audio applications (Watson, 2013). The JS plugin will interpret all frequency related information and will be responsible for assigning that data to a render node that will draw a separate line of the mandala for each oncoming sound, producing unique imagery.<br><br><br></p>
                    <h1>Skills Required</h1>
                    <p><br><strong>Development</strong><br>In order to realize this development, our team intends on acquiring a slim 42” diagonal length Samsung TV, modifying the housing in order to accommodate a Raspberry Pi behind the LED panel. The Raspberry Pi’s power supply will also be included within this unit and coupled with the power supply of the display itself, meaning that the device will only require one cable to operate.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Skills required to fully envision this project would include extensive knowledge in using the Linux command line, fluency in the JS programming language as well as adequate experience within the Raspberry Pi ecosystem. A JS plugin that can analyse and split incoming frequency into 5-6 separate bands currently exists, however a new piece of software will need to be written that efficiently render a colour/line for each frequency to produce patterns based on oncoming data from the noise gate. It is the later mentioned piece of software that will be responsible for rendering the 2D mandala, as well as determining the brightness and overall size of the pattern. piCore would need to be modified in order for it to prompt the launch of Reaper, the host of the JS plugin, upon turning on the device. Knowledge regarding piCore and the JS programming ecosystem is readily available on the internet however, and should not be difficult to acquire and apply to this project. Hardware required for this product is all currently available, with Samsung capable of manufacturing high resolution, transparent, flexible OLED screens, and the Raspberry Pi itself. The housing for the device would have to be self manufactured however.<br><br></p>

                        <p class="mb-0"></p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p><br>Difficulties which may arise in development of this product particularly lie within the rendering potential of the Raspberry Pi’s ARM based architecture. Stability may be questionable given ARM CPU’s tendency to throttle during prolonged, intensive workloads which the rendering software will present (Ivankov, 2020). This may be circumvented by potentially overclocking the CPU and providing adequate cooling, however this will add extra weight to the display.<br><br></p>
                    <h1>Overview</h1>
                    <p><br>Upon success, this product would effectively grant users an unprecedented, stress relieving, therapeutic audio visual experience that is cost effective and unobtrusive. The overall objective of this endeavour would be met, providing viewers with an entertaining, mood-accompanying product that would find itself at home in any environment, whether it be domestic or a commercial use case. A substantial impact throughout both art and home decor industries can also be anticipated, drawing new eyes to the innovations recent technological advancements such as the Raspberry Pi have enabled. This may prompt further hybrid developments utilizing both visual, audio, and open source linux based software, providing new forms of entertainment which were once unheard of, thus increasing the capacity for open source hardware/software as a medium for innovative developments to be fully realized.<br><br></p>
